In this project, we generated 8 synthetic data sets in order to compare four different optimization methods for the elastic net regularization problem.

We varied these data sets in terms of:

- Number of features
- Number of contributing features
- Number of observations
- Amount of noise

The four optimization methods used were:

- A commercial solver (Gurobi)
- Binary integer programming
- Gradient descent
- Pathwise coordinate descent

The four models showed different performance over the different data sets. For an elaborate overview, please see the report.
